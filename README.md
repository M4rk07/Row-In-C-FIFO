# Row In C (FIFO) - Faculty project #

### Description ###

The task was to demonstrate an implementation of a row (FIFO) in programming language C.
It was necessary to be implemented through an array and binary file.

I tried to demonstrate implementation in multiple ways and with different ideas.
Not every method is efficient, but ideas were in first plan.
